Copying the top-level directory.

Preparing a standardized list of skippable trees.
-------------------------------------------------
Now comparing elements of the following trees:
iTree = ['donotcopy1', 'donotcopy2', 'donotcopy3']
jTree = ['donotcopy1', 'okay_to_copy_yeah', 'literallypoison.txt']
Element 0 agrees!
Element 1 does not agree!
Now comparing elements of the following trees:
iTree = ['donotcopy1', 'donotcopy2']
jTree = ['donotcopy1', 'donotcopy2', 'donotcopy3']
Element 0 agrees!
Element 1 agrees!
Awesome! We found a redundant tree, jTreeIndex = 0
Now comparing elements of the following trees:
iTree = ['donotcopy1', 'donotcopy2']
jTree = ['donotcopy1', 'okay_to_copy_yeah', 'literallypoison.txt']
Element 0 agrees!
Element 1 does not agree!
Now comparing elements of the following trees:
iTree = ['alsodonotcopy']
jTree = ['donotcopy1', 'donotcopy2', 'donotcopy3']
Element 0 does not agree!
Now comparing elements of the following trees:
iTree = ['alsodonotcopy']

Element 0 does not agree!
Now comparing elements of the following trees:
iTree = ['alsodonotcopy']

Redundant tree removed: ['donotcopy1', 'donotcopy2', 'donotcopy3']
Remaining skippable trees:
